# Neo Noted Driver Android
## Description
Still in development, but Layers M1, M2, M3, M4 are fully implemented. Capslock behaviour is not yet implemented.
This is an extremely minimal implementation of the neo noted layout for android. I have been using neo noted for a while, really enjoying its comfort.

[original layout on github](https://github.com/dariogoetz/noted-layout)

This project was motivated because no noted implementation on the internet for android external keyboards matched my expectations.
An debug apk is available in the builds folder.

Please note that not all characters are perfectly done. This includes but is not limited to accent characters missing, and variations of the space key.
But everything I find use for is implemented. Go ahead and add an issue if you actually care for some features, they will be added.

Also accents are really hard to set up, and i dont think its worth it at the time.

## Installation
A debug apk is available in the builds folder.

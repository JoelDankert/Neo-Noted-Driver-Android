# Neo Noted Driver Android
Still in development, but Layers M1, M2, M3, M4 are fully implemented. M5 and M6 seem to only need remapping. Capslock behaviour is not yet implemented.
This is a extremely minimal implementation of the neo noted layout for android. I have been using neo noted for a while, really enjoying its comfort.

[original layout on github](https://github.com/dariogoetz/noted-layout)

This project was motivated because no noted implementation on the internet for android external keyboards matched my expectations.
an debug apk is available in the builds folder.

Please note that not all characters are perfectly done. such as accent characters missing and variances of space.
also some things i basically just forgot. but everything i find use for is implemented. go ahead and add an issue if you actually care for some features, they will be added.

# Neo Noted Driver Android
Still in development, but Layers M1, M2, M3, M4 are fully implemented. Capslock behaviour is not yet implemented.
This is an extremely minimal implementation of the neo noted layout for android. I have been using neo noted for a while, really enjoying its comfort.

[original layout on github](https://github.com/dariogoetz/noted-layout)

This project was motivated because no noted implementation on the internet for android external keyboards matched my expectations.
also accents are really hard to set up, and i dont think its worth at the time.
a debug apk is available in the builds folder.
